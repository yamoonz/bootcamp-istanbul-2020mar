Hi! My name is Eman[n]. 
I am living in Istanbul[n] and I am a student at Istanbul[n] University. 
Currently, I am a fellow at Re:Coded Front-End Web Develpment Bootcamp.
I am currently learning different web development languages
 such as Css[n], Html[n],and JavaScript[n]. 
I enjoy[v] coding because it gives me the freedom to be creative[a]. 
I believe that this bootcamp will bring me a lot 
of good[a] memories and good[a] friends.
