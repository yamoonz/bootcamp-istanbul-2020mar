Since i use my pc every day it can get really dirty[a], so I make sure to talk[v] with it every day, in order to keep it sprit[n] up. When it rains ill grab an umbrella[n] from the bathroom[n], and open it inside the room, Then I put some salt[n] on the keyboard to make shiny[a] and clean[a]. Lastly during the lockdown, I take my pc outside[a] for a walk, sometimes it barks[v] at people, and at night it goes under my blanket[n] and it cuddles[a] me. People sometimes think that I am crazy[a] but that is my relationship with my pc.
