During high-school[n], we were working[v] and my teacher[a] said[v] that we could listen to music[n] but if it was too loud he would “kill[v] us.”
So I’m doing my work[n] quietly with my music on low, and this obnoxious[a] kid sitting next to me had his music really loud. I could hear it over my music but ignored it. My teacher looked[v] and thought[v]it was me. so, he comes up to me & ripped[v] my BRAND-NEW headphones[n]. He suddenly realized it was the guy next to me and he was completely embarrassed. He came[v] in the next day with a new[n] pair and a note[a]. He couldn’t look[v] me in the eye[n] for the rest of the year[n].
