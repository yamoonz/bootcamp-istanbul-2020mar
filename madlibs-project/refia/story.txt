Mama, just killed[v] a man[n]. <br>
Put a gun[n] against his head[n], <br>
Pulled my trigger[n], now he's dead[adj]. <br>
Mama, life[n] had just begun, <br>
But now I've gone and thrown it all away. <br>

Mama, ooh[exc]. <br>
Didn't mean to make you cry[v]. <br>
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, <br>
Carry on, carry on, <br>
As if nothing[n] really matters. <br>
