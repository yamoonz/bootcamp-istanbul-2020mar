You[n], this is me being serious. In fact, this is my serious page[n]. It is where I come to be serious[a]. That page[n] is the most serious one I could find. I touched[v] at many, many of them. Hundreds of them. I really do not know how it is possible. The specific number is not as important as the understanding that of all the things that I looked at, this one is the most serious. I relate this story to impress upon you, the extent to which this is the most adjective[a] I have, which is why I brought you here. You just tried to verb[v], which, of course, runs the risk of breaking your mentality. It is time to get serious, fam. No jokes, no games. Outside of this page, I might be more tolerant of this noun[n], but now we are in this adjective[a] page. Which is why I am subjecting you to the most serious punishment I can think of, one hundred billion trillion years, standing here in the serious page. Perhaps after that, we can talk about the severity of your actions, and whether you have learned anything. But, until then, you should see how adjective[a] you have been.
