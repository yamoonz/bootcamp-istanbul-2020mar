Mad libs project. See [spec](https://repl.it/@louisrli/recoded-mad-libz)

## Presentation

Your demo will be 10 minutes. We will time it. It's not meant to be a high
pressure situation but we want to make sure that everyone has time to demo in
the allocated time.

### Requirements

Please read these instructions and prepare some thoughts on these for your demo.

* Show us your story and your work.
* All members must speak about and explain some part of the code that they
  wrote. **Remember the requirement that every member must be able to
  to explain any part of the code**.
* What were the three hardest problems that you faced?
* Reflection: all of the members must speak about what stood out to them
  about their learnings from the project. It can be abstract ("I learned how to
  better find my mistakes") or concrete ("I learned more about the DOM."). 
* Reflection: what do you think is the difference between working on a project
  and working on small exercises?
