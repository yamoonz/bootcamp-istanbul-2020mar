        <h2>My Article</h2>
        <p>Hi cohorts!! My name is Basil Al-Isa and I am form Syria. 
            <br> I'm a night person <b>(night owl)üòÅ,</b> fascinated by technology, and in love with <b>Python</b>üíî.
            Also, I <em>kill</em> three birds with one stone as <b>I sing, dance, and cook at the same time</b> and this how I manage my time. 
            Although I can't <i>function in the morning</i>, but I'm quite energetic and productive in the night. <br> I'm very excited to join this Bootcamp because I believe I will learn more quickly and thoroughly through this Bootcamp than I likely would on my own.
            It will offer us whatever support and additional motivation we need to learn and succeed. And the <b>most important part is to make new friends and become a part of a community of coders</b> which is a very valuable resource in itself.</p>
