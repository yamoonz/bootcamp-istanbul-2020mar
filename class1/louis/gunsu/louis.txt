Given a user input N, print all prime numbers below N (inclusive).

If the user gives 16:
2 3 5 7 11 13

get N from the user 
    Divide N to all numbers between 2 and squer root of N
        If N is able to be divided do not print
        if N=2 print N
    else
        print
    N=N-1
    go back to line 44
if N=1 stop
