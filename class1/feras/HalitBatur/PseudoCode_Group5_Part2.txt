Given an input N, print all of Prime numbers below N (inclusive)

1- number = (1 ...N ) inclusive 
2- if N/2 = odd number 
add +1 
print N 

plan b








1-what is the input ? The input is a random number (N)
2- what is the output ? a prime number between 2 and N (N is included)

take an input from the user and assign it to N
let i = 2
while (i is less than or equal N)
let x=2
while (x is less than or euqal i/2)
if 




print N

prime number= true;


n= 50

let i =2

while(i <=50)

let x =2
while(x <= i/2 && prime number=false )

if i%x = 0
prime number = false
